Welcome, aspiring cybersecurity enthusiasts! Whether you're a beginner eager to learn the ropes or a seasoned pro looking to sharpen your skills, you've come to the right place.

I advise you to take your time while learning, note down everything you find valuable, and never hesitate to search up difficult topics on Google and Youtube.

## Starting point (Linux)

If you're a CS or CYS student, you probably already have access to a Linux machine. If not, no worries! You can easily get access to one by installing Linux on a virtual machine such as VMWare, as I advise beginners to do.

For a tutorial on how to install Linux on VMWare, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwYH0NNWWzU" target="_blank">click here</a>.

**Note:** If you encounter any problems while installing both VMWare or the Linux machine, search for another tutorial online or <a href="#contact-section">Contact Me</a> for assistance. I also recommend that you use Kali Linux as there are different types of Linux machines.

## Getting Started: TryHackMe

After ensuring you're set up with the right tools, head over to <a href="https://tryhackme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TryHackMe</a> to create your free account.

TryHackMe is a site that offers a wide range of interactive labs, challenges, and courses designed to help you master cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on, engaging way, perfect for beginning your journey or even advancing your skills.

**Note:** It's not necessary to access TryHackMe on a Linux machine. Some labs can be completed on Windows only.

You can also use the Attack Box (explained shortly) on a Windows operating system to complete TryHackMe labs, as you're given the choice to specify on top of the page in each lab you pick, as shown below.

## Tutorial: OpenVPN Setup

Before starting with hands-on labs, you might face issues not knowing how to start your TryHackMe lab. No worries! Check out this helpful tutorial on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUsXg8dKds&t=302s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> that walks you through setting up and using OpenVPN, then how to start any lab that does not need a TryHackMe subscription.

**Note:** When clicking on "(Access Machine)" as in the picture below on top of each page after choosing a lab, you'll find a guide on how to start/use OpenVPN or the Attack Box.

If you choose a VPN server, select the one closest to your geographical location for optimal performance and minimal latency.

## Attack box in TryHackMe

In TryHackMe, there is a feature called the attack box which is a virtual lab environment for practicing cybersecurity techniques safely. It can be used without the need for VPN or having a Linux environment as it provides one virtually. Unfortunately, it has a downside; it can be used for limited hours a day freely and requires you to subscribe to TryHackMe to use it as long as you want. If interested in it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE2sQuxmuHw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a> for a guide, the video also goes through the TryHackMe tutorial lab which might be helpful.

## Hands-on Labs

Now that you are all set up, you'll start with the labs below. For each lab, I will provide a link and a walkthrough for it if needed, as some of the labs already have tutorials. If you want to learn, then cheating from the tutorial without trying yourself is not a very good idea.

1. **Fundamentals**
   - This is a lab that you will find some important basic concepts that you should know as a beginner such as IPs, domain names, hash values, and more.

2. **Introduction to Kali Linux**
   - Here you will learn everything you need to know about Linux, try your best to complete the three rooms.

   - <button style="color: black; margin-bottom: 10px;" onclick="window.open('https://tryhackme.com/r/room/linuxfundamentalspart1', '_blank')">Introduction to Kali Linux p.1 lab</button>
   - <button style="color: black; margin-bottom: 10px;" onclick="window.open('https://tryhackme.com/r/room/linuxfundamentalspart2', '_blank')">Introduction to Kali Linux p.2 lab</button>
   - <button style="color: black; margin-bottom: 10px;" onclick="window.open('https://tryhackme.com/r/room/linuxfundamentalspart3', '_blank')">Introduction to Kali Linux p.3 lab</button>
   The third part might be a bit challenging but try your best to complete all of it.

3. **Basic Network Reconnaissance**
   - Here there will be two rooms for you to learn about fundamentals of network reconnaissance. Reconnaissance involves surveying or scanning systems, networks, or web applications to gather information about potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Although our site focuses on blue teaming (defense in cybersecurity), it's important to gain knowledge about the tools used in these labs, especially passive (remotely) and active (interactively) reconnaissance.

   - <button style="color: black; margin-bottom: 10px;" onclick="window.open('https://tryhackme.com/r/room/passiverecon', '_blank')">Passive reconnaissance lab</button>
   - <button style="color: black; margin-bottom: 10px;" onclick="window.open('https://medium.com/@riteshs4hu/a-beginners-guide-to-passive-reconnaissance-techniques-and-tools-b08502ba93', '_blank')">Passive reconnaissance lab walkthrough</button>
   - <button style="color: black; margin-bottom: 10px;" onclick="window.open('https://tryhackme.com/r/room/activerecon', '_blank')">Active reconnaissance lab</button>

   4. **Introduction to OSINT Tools**
   - OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) Tools are invaluable resources for gathering information from publicly available sources. From social media analysis to domain reconnaissance, OSINT tools enable users to collect data efficiently and ethically. Perfect for investigators, researchers, and cybersecurity professionals alike, again these are not specifically blue teaming rooms but are essential for gaining a solid foundation in cybersecurity.

5. **Web Application Security Basics with OWASP ZAP**
   - OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is a powerful open-source web application security scanner that helps identify vulnerabilities in web applications during development and testing phases. With its user-friendly interface and extensive features, OWASP ZAP assists in detecting security flaws, such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and broken authentication. It's an essential tool for ensuring the security of web applications, and in this lab, you'll learn everything you need to know about it.

6. **Autopsy**
   - Autopsy, the detective toolkit! From analyzing disk images to uncovering hidden clues, Autopsy helps you piece together the puzzle of digital evidence. Essential for <a href="https://www.devry.edu/blog/what-is-computer-forensics.html#:~:text=Computer%20forensics%20is%20a%20field,encompasses%20areas%20outside%20of%20investigations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forensics</a> experts, it is considered the key to unlocking insights from the depths of digital data.

   **Note:** If this is your first time interacting with Autopsy, then watching the walkthrough before or while doing the lab is allowed.

   Use the attack box.

   - <button style="color: black; margin-bottom: 10px;" onclick="window.open('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjDKgdoFufo', '_blank')">Autopsy Lab walkthrough</button>

7. **Lab 5: OWASP Top 10**
   - Now that you reached this point, you're ready for the OWASP Top 10 TryHackMe lab as it provides hands-on experience with the most critical web application security risks identified by the (Open Web Application Security Project). You'll learn about lots of common vulnerabilities, so take your time with it as it might be a bit long but extremely beneficial.

   In case you encounter difficulties with the Cryptography section in the lab, jump to <a href="/level_2" class="button">Level 2</a> and come back when you feel ready.

   - <button style="color: black; margin-bottom: 10px;" onclick="window.open('https://tryhackme.com/r/room/owasptop102021', '_blank')">OWASP top 10 lab</button>

**Note:** There is another interesting lab in TryHackMe under the name "OWASP Top 10". Check it out if you have time.

## Congratulations

You have completed Level 1 of the gate. I hope you benefited a lot as everything next will be much easier to absorb from now on. If you're looking forward to exploring more free rooms on the topics we went through, ready to unlock the secrets of cybersecurity, prove it and head over to <a href="/level_2" class="button">Level 2</a>.

Happy hacking!
