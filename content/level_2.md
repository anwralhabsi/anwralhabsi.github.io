## Welcome to Level 2

If you reached this point, you're ready to get Introduced to encryption methods, decryption techniques and many interesting tools.

Cryptography and Encryption are both huge topics which makes it very hard to go through in whole, but for this level I will do my best to scratch its surface so you can get a solid foundation.

**Note:** If you've completed the "OWASP top 10" lab in <a href="/level_1" class="button">Level 1</a> you should have a good idea on cryptographic failures by now. If not and you came here to grasp good knowledge before heading back, then buckle up.

We already learned how to run our TryHackMe labs in <a href="/level_1" class="button">Level 1</a> now we will get straight into it.

## Hands-on Labs

1. **Cryptography for Dummies** 
   - This is a pretty easy introduction to cryptography to set you up correctly, have fun ;)

2. **Introduction to Cryptography** 
   - Now after you got a quick overview in lab 1 you are ready to get a wider view on what cryptography is. I advise you to take your time and note down all that you find helpful as you were advised before.

   3. **Introduction to Cryptography 2 (optional)** 
   - Extra information about cryptography will be found in this lab. I made it optional because we covered most of its topics and also it might be a bit more challenging to understand for beginners. Those who feel comfortable enough should definitely complete it.

4. **A quick game** 
   - Here is a fun game that is designed to explain how two ends exchange data while ensuring no third party can intercept it. ENJOY.

5. **Cryptography & Malware Analysis** 
   - This lab is a brief example of how all sections of Cyber Security connect. Here we use knowledge we got from level 2 (Checksums) to look into material in level 3 which is Malware Analysis.

## Well done
Hooray!! Now that you completed level 2, we are ready to spice it up as it is now time for <a href="/level_3" class="button">Level 3</a>.
